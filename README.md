# beamCalculator
A simple GUI application for 2D engineering analysis of beam models. Users can calculate the max bending moment, shear force, and deflection of a custom 2D beam model.
Users also have the ability to display and save labeled free body diagrams, bending moment plots, shear force plots, and deflection plots. 

## What I Learned
* Objected Oriented Programming with Python
* GUI Development using [PyQt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/) and [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html)
* Unit testing GUI's with [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/)
# Features
* Allows users to create a customised 2D beam model
  * specify beam length
  * specify force location
  * specify joint location
  * supports point loads and UDL's
  * supports cantilever, roller and pin joints
  * supports Steel AISI 1045 and Cast Iron Grade20 materials 
  * supports both solid and hollow cross-sections
  * supports square and circulr cross sections
