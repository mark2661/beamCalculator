# beamCalculator
A simple GUI application for 2D engineering analysis of beam models. Users can calculate the max bending moment, shear force, and deflection of a custom 2D beam model.
Users also have the ability to display and save labeled free body diagrams, bending moment plots, shear force plots, and deflection plots. 

# What I Learned
* Objected Oriented Programming with Python
* GUI Development using [PyQt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/) and [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html)
* Unit testing GUI's with [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/)
