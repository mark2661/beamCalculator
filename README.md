# beamCalculator
A simple GUI application for 2D engineering analysis of beam models. Users can calculate the max bending moment, shear force, and deflection of a custom 2D beam model.
Users also have the ability to display and save labeled free body diagrams, bending moment plots, shear force plots, and deflection plots.
